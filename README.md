# Sign Language Detection

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a machine learning model for detecting and interpreting sign language gestures. The model leverages neural networks to classify various sign language gestures into their corresponding letters or words.

## Dependencies:
1. Tensorflow

2. Keras

3. OpenCV

## Dataset:

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Jupyter installed. You can install Jupyter via pip if you don't have it already:

```sh
pip install jupyter
```

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detection.git
cd sign-language-detection
```

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install tensorflow pydot graphviz numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To start the Jupyter Notebook, run:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `Signlanguagedetection.ipynb` notebook in your browser and run the cells to execute the code step by step.

## Project Structure

- `Signlanguagedetection.ipynb`: Main notebook file containing code for sign language detection.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `results/`: Directory to save results and visualizations.

## Model Training

The notebook guides you through the following steps for training the sign language detection model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **Model Building**: Creating a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. **Model Training**: Training the model on the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on test data.

## Evaluation

The notebook includes cells for evaluating the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualizations like confusion matrices and classification reports are also generated to help understand the model's performance.

## Visualization

To visualize the model architecture, ensure you have `pydot` and `graphviz` installed. You can visualize the model by running the following command in the notebook:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
plot_model(model, to_file='model.png', show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)
```
